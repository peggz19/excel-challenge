This Peggy Tadi's Excel Challenge

Please note that to create the columns "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category", instead of using a formula (as specified), I went under the Data tab and used the "text to columns" option. (I wasn't sure what formula we were referring to)

Thanks for reading this very small note !
